# EE 344 – Assignment 1: Regression Modeling

This repository contains **Assignment 1** for **EE 344: Data-Driven Modeling and Machine Learning (Winter 2026)** at the University of Washington.

## Assignment Overview

### Part 1: Fuel Consumption → Horsepower Prediction
- Predict vehicle horsepower based on fuel consumption features
- Train linear regression and polynomial regression models (degrees 2–4)
- Evaluate models using MSE, MAE, and R² on both training and test sets
- Compare model performance and discuss underfitting vs. overfitting

### Part 2: Weather → Electricity Consumption Prediction
- Predict daily electricity consumption using weather data
- Train linear and polynomial regression models (degrees 2–4)
- Report and compare train/test performance metrics
- Provide data-driven discussion on model generalization and nonlinear effects
